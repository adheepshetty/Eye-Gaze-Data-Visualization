# Eye-Gaze-Data-Visualization

The aim of this assignment is to show participant five's gaze in the form of visualization and answer following questions on the basis of visualization:
<ol>
 <li>Did the user struggle more when searching or processing the given visual information?
 <li>Was the user more successful at completing the given task when using one visual support than the other?
 <li>How long was the user’s eyes were fixated at a particular point?   
</ol>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to provide interactive visualization support to users who are interested in explorative activities, e.g. finding “interesting” things, examine the dataset by exploring whether a particular feature/trend/pattern is present, etc. </p>

## Rough Plan

## Input Files
p5 - Participant 5
graph - Participant is looking at Graph Visualization.<br>
tree - Participant is looking at Tree Visualization.<br>
EVD - Data of Events that is done by the participant.<br>

FXD - Fixation data shows for how long participant's eyes were fixated.<br>

GZD - Gives information about participant's gaze like his/her pupil size distance from screen.<br>
